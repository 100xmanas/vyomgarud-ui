# What I Learned

This project was an assignment from **VyomGarud** to create a modern, responsive landing page for their company. I completed the project within 2 days, including both the full landing page design and ensuring responsiveness across devices.

During the development, I learned:
- Structuring a **modern React project** with reusable components.  
- Implementing **responsive design** using Tailwind CSS breakpoints.  
- Using **Framer Motion** to add smooth animations for UI interactions.
